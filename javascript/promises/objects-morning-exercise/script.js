/*
Objective: We are going to create an object Radio!
How to begin:
1. Create a variable called radio and assign as its value an object literal
2. Give it a property called stations and make the value an array of
station objects (at least 2)
3. Give each station object a property called name and songs. Name
should be a string and songs should be an array of song objects (at
least 3).
4. Song objects should have two properties: title and artist
5. Create a method on your radio object that changes the station
randomly (research Math.random and Math.floor)
6. When the station is changed, pick a song from that station. Example:
console.log("Now Playing:" + song.title + "by" + song.artist)
